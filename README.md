# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
The purpose of this code is to clean and go through movie data from IMDB from a file from Kaggle. The data is cleaned and uploaded onto SQL in tables using python code. This was completed by using Jupyter Notebook to code the program in Python and the tables are pushed onto SQL. 

## Election-Audit Results:
The analysis of the tables show that:
- There are 6052 rows in the movies table.
- There are 26,024,286 rows in the ratings table.

These row amounts match the results of the case study.
    
## Challenge Summary
This script was written to clean data from csv files and using both files to fill in missing data. Once completed, the clean set is pushed to SQL for query searching.
